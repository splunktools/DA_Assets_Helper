# Asset and Identity Helper
## DA_Assets_Helper

The Asset and Identity Helper is provided to assist users in creating and maintaining sources for the Asset and Identity Framework inside Splunk Enterprise Security. In order to use the functionality in this app you must have Splunk Enterprise Security installed and configured prior to use of this app.

## Features

- Best practices instructions
- Assets and Identities Source Dashboard for managing all searches/sources
- Debug Asset Data Dashboard for determining root cause for asset merger errors
- Asset Search Dashboard
- Identity Search Dashboard
- Various macros

## Installation

Install the app using the same method as any other TA by using the Manage Apps section in Splunk and either installing directly from Splunkbase or install from the file. Enterprise Security is required and must already be set up to use the A&I framework. No additional setup is needed for this help app.

## Usage

The best method of using this app is to use the instructions located in the Adding Sources to A&I Dashboard which provides some direction on how to use the A&I framework.

### Best Practices
Naming conventions to make it easier to identify reports, CSVs, and lookups that ingest into Assets and Identity
- Assets_Identities_**DataSourceName**_lookup Report
- Assets_Identities_**DataSourceName**_lookup.csv
- Assets_Identities_**DataSourceName**_lookup

Schedule at off hours and stagger them
```
Interval = 6 2 * * *
```
**Use Macros to standardize data cleanup**

This macro formats the multi-value fields so they can be stored in lookups
```
`multivalue_fields_for_lookup`
```
This macro is design to remove invalid IPs (home IPs) and you can edit this macro to match your needs
```
`remove_home_ip`
```
This macro is designed to deduplicate multivalue fields
```
`remove_duplicates`
```
Example of a search adding endpoint data to A&I
```
index="endpoint" 
| rename hostname as nt_host, os AS OS 
| stats values(domain) as domain, values(OS) as OS, values(ip) as ip, values(mac) as mac latest(_time) as last_checked_in by nt_host 
| eval security_tooling="endpoint" 
| eval meta="ep_last_discovered: ".strftime(last_checked_in,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    `remove_home_ip` 
    `remove_ip_based_on_os`
    `multivalue_fields_for_lookup`
| outputlookup Assets_Identity_Endpoint_lookup.csv
```

Example of a search looking for Splunk Data

```
| tstats latest(_time) as last_data_ingested where `splunk_data_indexes` by host 
| rex field="host" "(?<nt_host>[a-zA-Z0-9\_\-]+)" 
| eval nt_host=if(match(host,"^(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$"),null(),nt_host) 
| rename host as dns  
| eval security_tooling="splunk" 
| eval ip=if(match(dns,"^(?:[0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}$"),dns,null()) 
| eval dns=if(isnull(ip),dns,null()) 
`remove_home_ip`
| eval meta="sp_data_last_ingested: ".strftime(last_data_ingested,"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    `multivalue_fields_for_lookup`
| outputlookup Assets_Identity_Splunk_Data_OS_lookup.csv
```
